# Privacy Statement
Certain identifying information may be retained when a tournament is archived. That information may include, but not be limited to, the following:
- User's discord ID number and discord username, 
- submitted name and pronouns, 
- submitted deck name and deck link, and
- ID and name of the server and channel user registered in.

Some of this information is also retained on the TOBot Moxfield profile in addition to the TOB(y) archive.

I will do my best to keep the above list up-to-date (and do not anticipate recording any further identifying information), but do not guarantee its accuracy.

Currently, the archived information is not used for any purpose. In the future, I hope to use the archived information to generate insights into canlander matchups and other data points I or the community find interesting. Archived information will not be sold and will not be provided to third parties except through publicly available means (none are currently developed or planned).

You can request removal of your identifying information from the archive by reaching out to me (ManaGeorge) on Discord.
